# HumanDispersalModel

Source code for the "Our Way Model" human dispersal simulation, developed by Dr. Christian Wegener for the CRC806 project. 
As the model is currently still in development and subject to major changes and a possible rewrite, the documentation is rather rudimentary.
Information about the physical description of the model, as well as test simulations, applications and previous documentations, can be found in the links below.

For installation and usage, check the corresponding .txt files.

The first functional version of the model, as presented within the doctoral thesis, can be found here: https://github.com/ChrisWege/HumanDispersalModel-legacy

By using or modifying any of the presented code, you agree to give credit and cite the published thesis (https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/54602/). This code was created as part of the CRC 806 "Our Way to Europe" funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG, project ID 57444011).
