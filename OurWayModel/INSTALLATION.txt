The model is located in "OurWayModel" as several source files written in Fortran.
Pre- and post-processing is done using Python 3 scripts.
Some example input data can be found in "data".

Installation time: a few minutes up to an hour, depending on the amount of requirements already met by your system

REQUIREMENTS to use the model:

UNIX Operation system (e.g Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS)

OurWayModel:
A Fortran compiler (e.g. gfortran 11.3.0 or newer) with shared memory multi-processing (e.g. OpenMP with the version number depending on gfortran version)
netcdf and netcdf-f installed and properly linked libraries

Pre- and Postprocessing with Python:
Python 3.10 or newer

Packages:
netCDF4 (1.21.5 or newer)
numpy (1.5.8 or newer)
geographiclib (2.0 or newer)

Optional:
ncview (program) to get a first look at the data within a netCDF file (.nc)
xarray (python-package) to open netCDF files in a simpler and more "pythonic" way
matplotlib combined with cartopy (python-packages): allows to create plots of the data with various projections on the earth's surface
